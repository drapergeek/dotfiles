## Context
This upgrades the $1 gem. This is part of an ongoing process to try and update our dependencies and keep them up to date.

## Timing
Whenever. I usually drop in a bunch of updates at one time but I don't care when
they go out. That's up to secondary to make a good call on what's safe to
deploy. I'm hoping that by breaking them up, we can toss in one or two per
deploy and not introduce too many variability in case something breaks.

## Notes
Hopefully, things work perfectly. If not, I sincerely apologize. Feel free to revert this PR. If you do, please put a notice on the attached Trello card so I can be certain to look into it. Thank you!
